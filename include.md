This application is based on the primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially-recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates. You can get data from the word bank database and analyse any two indicators and their mutual relationship over period of time. 

Source code is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/akbism/developing-data-products-shiny).

Process to use the app:

1. Please go to "Indicators Details" tab and find out the series codes of the concerned indicators. You can use search option for each column or a generic search to find appropriate indicators.

2. Check the data fetched from the World Bank database in "WorldBank Data" tab. (Optional).

3. Next, you check in "Visualization" tab. Set the color and size parameter as per your need. You can select countries, which you want to follow in the motion chart. 

4. The next feature is visualization of individual parameters in the world map. Please keep patience, the visualization takes some time ( 3-5 minutes).

5. Finally, I am planning to add a feature in the world map that traces the centre of the individual indicators on the world map over period of time.

Disclaimer: This application ignores all lines, which have missing data.
